OBJECTIVE

SCOPE
The objective of this document is to outline the requirements for the
development of a single vendor ecommerce website.

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a single vendor
ecommerce portal consisting of the following main modules:
• Homepage: The homepage serves as the entry point for users visiting your
e-commerce website. It typically includes featured products, promotions, and
navigation options to explore different sections of the website.
• Product Catalog Module: This module is the core of your e-commerce
website, where users can browse and search for products. It includes
features like product listings, filters, search functionality, and product details
pages.
• Shopping Cart Module: The shopping cart module allows users to add
products to their cart while shopping. Users can view the contents of their
cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout. It also handles calculations
for the total cost of items in the cart.
• Order Management Module: This module manages the entire order
lifecycle. It includes functionalities such as order placement, order tracking,
order history, and order confirmation. Both customers and administrators can
access this module to view and manage orders.
• Admin Panel: The admin panel is a backend interface for administrators to
manage the ecommerce website. It includes functionalities like adding,
editing, and removing products, managing orders, monitoring user accounts,
and analyzing sales data.
• Inventory Management: Inventory management is crucial for tracking
product availability. This module helps administrators keep track of stock
levels and update product availability based on sales and restocking.

• User Management: User management handles user accounts and profiles.
It allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Administrators
can also manage user accounts, including user roles and access permissions.
• Payments & Transactions: This module integrates payment gateways to
facilitate secure and seamless transactions. Users can choose their preferred
payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) during checkout. The module
ensures the processing of payments and records transaction history.
• Customization Module: This module allows the user to view the dresses
they have selected in a panel where they can choose to alter the patterns of
the dress in areas such as the neck, sleeve and the dress length. Once
chosen the customer’s designs will be saved and can choose to order the
dress in the selected design and pattern.
